# Dvorak Shmorak

This is my personal Dvorak layout for Swedish keyboards.

I designed this layout with my own personal taste in mind, keeping the `',.` keys in the same place as standard Dvorak, with `åäö` available using no modifiers.

I also decided to put common programming symbols (<()>\[]/{}) under the left hand when using the AltGr modifier key.
